Project 1: Boolean Logic
  - This project involves the construction of a typical set of basic logic gates.
Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic (Learn how to implement 
  - Build all the chips leading up to an Arithmetic Logic Unit. 
Project 3: Sequential Logic
  - Learn how to use gate logic to store bits persistently, over time, and to locate ("address") the memory register on which we wish to operate.
Project 4: Machine Language
  - Learn how to write low level assembly language
Project 5: Computer Architecture
  - Learn how to build the computer using the chips designed in previous projects
Project 6: Assembler
  - Learn to write your own assembler to convert assembly language into machine language binary instructions
